#The official Junction server charter

##General Guidelines
No staff member is more important than any other. No one person is in charge of any aspect of gameplay, or operations. Decisions should and will be made as laid out by these guidelines, precluding the need for any individual to act as if they are in charge.
**Junction is a server based around a community working together to have fun.**

##Player Guidelines
1\. **Be respectful of everyone on the server**, whether it be someone brand new or someone in a staff position, through words and actions. Disrespectful actions include using racial or homophobic slurs, harassing fellow players and/or staff, being an unreasonable annoyance to other players, or behaving in a way that is disruptive or unhelpful.  In a survival setting, some banter is expected but should not reach a level of harassment.

2\. **No griefing**. Griefing includes but is not limited to:

- Destroying a build
- Modifying a build without the owner’s consent, or preventing an owner’s access to their build
- Spamming blocks or building any representation of genitalia in any area
- Flooding a structure
- Killing others stabled animals, villagers, or taking crops without replanting

3\. **We do not allow discussion promoting griefing in any way, shape or form** via communication mediums provided by Junction. This includes the in-game chat, subreddit, Mumble, forum or IRC channels.

4\. **Be mindful of space**, give other builds room to breathe. On the same note, no one build holds priority over another. A large city/build may not be considered more valuable than the humble home of a single player.

5\. **Use of mods that give you an advantage over other players is unacceptable**. This includes but is not limited to: x-ray clients, speed hacking, flying hacks, etc. If you have a question about a specific mod, please check the [Junction Subreddit](/r/Junction).  Someone may have asked this question before. If not, please post and ask.

6\. **Do not create structures that will harm the efficient operation of the server**. This includes redstone machines that are on clocks and cannot be turned off, or pistons and dispensers that are activated without players deliberately doing so.

7\. **Be mindful of your drops**: Do not leave your cobble lying around! This makes the server sad. It takes very little in terms of space and resources to carry a bucket of lava with you to destroy entities you do not intend to store.

8\. **Keep the server SFW!** Aside from just not building suggestive structures, make sure the skin you use is also clothed - and preferably not offensive. Some skins, such as Hitler, are obviously offensive. Staff reserve the right to kick players using blatantly offensive skins and ask them to change their skin before logging on again.

9\. **Please don't spam chat**. Also, advertising other servers is strictly prohibited.

10\. **Keep your issues with other servers to those servers.** Junction is not a staging ground for attacks on servers you dislike. Discussion promoting attacks on other servers and/or its members is prohibited.

Players who cannot abide by these guidelines will be subject to the section “[When Someone Breaks the Rules](#toc_8).”

##Protections and YOU!
**Staff protects builds, not claims**. It’s an anti-griefing measure, not a land-grab technique. To make a protection request, mark the corners of your build with something that stands out and that you can remove later, then use /modreq and tell us what we are protecting (adding coordinates in the req also helps).

##You Can't Get Ye Item!
**These items cannot be placed by players**. This list is as short as possible, and is intended solely to prevent griefing or widespread damage.

- Flint and steel (modreq for fire)
- Flowing water (modreq for it!)
- Flowing lava (modreq for it!)
- TNT
- Nether Portals

This list may change in the future, subject to a rules change proposal.

##When Someone Breaks The Rules
If a player breaks the rules or persists in ignoring the player guidelines, **they are subject to sanction**. While the rules violation will largely dictate the response, the first offense commonly results in the player being kicked from the server. Players who flagrantly break the rules, or continue to break the rules after being kicked, can be banned **with or without warning**. 

Bans can, of course, be appealed. The appeals process will be located on the website. Please do not appeal or discuss appeals outside of the proper venue. Using an alt to evade a ban is prohibited; **DO NOT DO THIS**.
If a staff member breaks the rules, or if there is a dispute with the staff member, **please take it to the Arbitration Committee**. If a member of the Arbitration Committee is involved in the dispute, that member is expected to recuse themselves.

##Staff Guidelines
**The Number One Rule:** Real life and health always come first. This isn’t a job, it’s a game.

*The Other Number One Rule:* Always be professional in your dealings. Try not to do staff stuff while inebriated, angry, or sleepy! We are here, first and foremost, to help operate the server for the people that want to play - and as such, it is never acceptable to be rude or otherwise unprofessional to the players, even if you think they deserve it.

**Some decisions need no discussion**. For example: simple bans, answering modreqs, and day-to-day operations. These can be handled by staff unilaterally.

**Most other decisions require discussion and consensus**, and should not be handled unilaterally. For anything changing gameplay, affecting server functions, or materially changing the way the community functions, staff consensus needs to be reached. Suggestions or proposals regarding significant issues should be posted to the [staff subreddit](/r/JunctionStaff) **FIRST**. Issues presented to the staff will be given a reasonable amount of time for discussion. This amount of time may vary; some issues will be minor enough to reach a consensus on in a couple of days, while larger issues may require a week or more. There are three reasons why this process is in place:

1. This ensures that every active staff member is well aware of changes being made; unless you’re on vacation or hiatus, you should not be blindsided by any major changes.
2. There is a permanent, written record of the discussion. This means that IRC and Mumble are not acceptable for achieving consensus. If you feel something needs to be said, it needs to go on the record. After all, accountability is always a good thing.
3. The larger the issue, the more it needs a purposeful discussion. This process is in place because we don’t want decisions made in haste or without proper consideration. Problems should be resolved, not kicked down the road and allowed to fester.

###Decisions and Consensus
**A decision that affects the community requires a consensus**.  This means a proposal or change should have the approval of a 2/3 majority of the staff.  If a consensus cannot be reached by staff alone, it can be brought in front of players to be voted on and discussed. This is not a forum for staff members unhappy with a decision to take their case to the public; this process is intended for non-staff players to voice their concerns.  If a decision is brought forth to the general public, it’s acceptable to argue for or against the proposal on its merits, but try to avoid turning a public debate into an argument about staff decision.

**Once a decision is made, staff should not publicly second-guess or disparage the decision**. Please remember: These guidelines regarding staff conduct are here because we all equally represent the server to the community. Publicly complaining does not accomplish anything; it only makes things worse, it looks unprofessional.

When something needs discussion, **time is always on our side**. Waiting to make a decision is always preferable to a hasty or bad decision. In the event of major security issues, the server will be taken down and the staff will work to resolve the security issue as soon as practicable. If the issue allows the server to remain open but requires normal servers to be closed, a temporary chaos server will be created (or re-loaded). This is in accordance with our underlying philosophy that we are here to foster our community, and our community is best served by maintaining a place to play whenever practicable.

###Responsibilities
**Junction uses committees for certain functions because a small number of dedicated people can concentrate on specific things and accomplish those things quicker**.  All players and staff are welcome to give feedback to committees on their respective issues.  Many committees will include experienced non-staff players.  This is intended to allow people who are not part of the staff to be involved - and to ensure the community is broadly represented - in important matters such as resolving player disputes and planning future server revisions.

- Tech Committee: These are the people making sure our server is happy and healthy. Before changing anything that changes gameplay, the Tech Committee needs to bring their proposal to the rest of the staff for discussion. The Tech Committee and the staff are charged with recognizing that holding the keys to the server - as with all staff positions - is a responsibility and not a privilege.
- Arbitration Committee: This committee will transition from revision to revision, and be comprised of both staff and experienced non-staff players. This Committee’s purpose is to resolve fairly any game-related dispute between players or between players and staff, such as issues related to in-game behavior or contested land claims.
- Other Committees: Junction will create or revise other committees as necessary, including revision planning committees.
